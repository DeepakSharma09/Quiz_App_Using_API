# Quiz App

A simple and interactive quiz app built with **Flutter**. The app fetches quiz questions from an API, allows users to answer them, and provides a review screen to check their answers.

## Features

1. **Fetch Questions from API**:
   - The app fetches quiz questions from a remote API (e.g., `https://api.jsonserve.com/Uw5CrX`).
   - Each question includes a description and multiple options, with one correct answer.

2. **Interactive Quiz Interface**:
   - Users can select an option for each question.
   - The app provides immediate feedback on whether the selected answer is correct or wrong.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - Correct answers add 4 points to the total score.
   - Wrong answers deduct 1 point from the total score.

4. **Review Screen**:
   - After completing the quiz, users can review their answers.
   - The review screen displays each question, the user's answer, and the correct answer.

5. **Responsive UI**:
   - The app features a clean and responsive user interface built with Flutter widgets.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Handles API errors and displays appropriate messages to the user.
   - Ensures the app doesn't crash if the API response is invalid or incomplete.

```
GET https://api.jsonserve.com/Uw5CrX
```

### Sample API Response

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "description": "What is 2 + 2?",
      "options": [
        {"description": "3", "is_correct": false},
        {"description": "4", "is_correct": true},
        {"description": "5", "is_correct": false}
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "What is the capital of France?",
      "options": [
        {"description": "Berlin", "is_correct": false},
        {"description": "Paris", "is_correct": true},
        {"description": "Madrid", "is_correct": false}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Fetching Questions**:
   - The app makes an HTTP GET request to the API endpoint to fetch the quiz questions.
   - The questions are stored in a list and displayed on the home screen.

2. **Answering Questions**:
   - Users select an option for each question.
   - The app checks if the selected option is correct and updates the score accordingly.

3. **Reviewing Answers**:
   - After completing the quiz, users can navigate to the review screen.
   - The review screen displays each question, the user's answer, and the correct answer.

---

## Dependencies

The app uses the following dependencies:

- **http**: For making HTTP requests to fetch quiz questions.
- **flutter/material.dart**: For building the UI components.

Add the following to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  http: ^0.13.3
```

## Customization

You can customize the app by:

1. **Changing the API Endpoint**:
   Update the API endpoint in the `Homepage.dart` file to fetch questions from a different source.

2. **Modifying the UI**:
   Customize the colors, fonts, and layout in the `Homepage.dart`, `Completed.dart`, and `ReviewScreen.dart` files.

3. **Adding More Features**:
   - Add a timer for each question.
   - Implement a leaderboard to track high scores.
   - Allow users to select quiz categories.
